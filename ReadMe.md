</h2>
    ## API Test Automation Framework
    This framework design ensures maintainable and readable testcode, relaible test execution with retry mechanisms and clear separtion of concern.[click](link)

    ### Implentation Pattern
    * API Client; to encapsulate Http operations and session management.
    * Custom assertions; implement using *chai assertion library* to allow testcases to focus on the intent rather than the mechanics of verifications
    * Contract Testing; implement using *Json Schema* to test the contracts indepently of the actual implementation, ensuring that changes in one service dont break the functionality for the other.

    ### Others Utilies
    * Logging; implement using *winston.js* to collect the test execution log process
    * CI/CD; using *github actions* to integrate the test into ci/cd pipeline and generate test report artifacts.
