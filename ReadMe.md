<h2>
  PERSONAL PROJECT
</h2>
    <b>API Test Automation Framework</b><br>
    This framework design ensures maintainable and readable testcode, relaible test execution with retry mechanisms and clear separtion of concern.[click](link)

  #### Implentation Pattern
  - API Client; to encapsulate Http operations and session management.
  - Custom assertions; implement using *chai assertion library* to allow testcases to focus on the intent rather than the mechanics of verifications
  - Contract Testing; implement using *Json Schema* to test the contracts indepently of the actual implementation, ensuring that changes in one service dont break the functionality for the other.

  #### Others Utilies
  - Logging; implement using *winston.js* to collect the test execution log process
  - CI/CD; using *github actions* to integrate the test into ci/cd pipeline and generate test report artifacts.
